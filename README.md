# Project Based on Flexgrid Control by .Net Franework/Core

FlexGrid for WPF is a lightweight data grid control designed on a flexible object model. Based on the popular WinForms version, FlexGrid offers many unique features such as unbound mode, flexible cell merging, and multi-cell row and column headers that make it a proven solution for data management and tabulation.
Like other data visualization controls, FlexGrid supports bound mode and can be populated with data from various data sources. The below section discusses bound FlexGrid in .NET 4.5.2 and .NET 5 versions.
The C1FlexGrid class provides the ItemsSource property to populate data in the grid. In WPF, the ItemsSource property binds FlexGrid to IEnumerable interface, or to DataCollection interface.
